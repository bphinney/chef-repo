# mod_cdn will only CDNify links in HTML if the Content-Type of the
# object being delivered matches one that's been specified.  Include
# any content-types that equate to (X)HTML; here are the standard
# ones:
CDNHTMLContentType text/html application/xhtml+xml

# Typically we want to replace links to static content, e.g., images,
# static HTML files, javascript, CSS, etc.  First we have to specify
# (X)HTML tags and attributes where we'll look for links to replace.
# In general when CDNifying a site, we don't want to replace URLs in
# all the places they might occur in HTML; for example, we probably
# don't want form submissions to go through the CDN.  I've left
# commented a couple of tags/attributes where there will be URLs we
# probably don't want to CDNify.  Note: this list is based on that
# from mod_proxy_html 3.0.1.

# Here's the declaration for W3C HTML 4.01 and XHTML 1.0:

CDNHTMLLinks    base            href
